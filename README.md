In this project I created an online clothing store.
I connected postgree databse, created product and user cart models, worked with migrations and orm. created slusses and functions based on OOP. 
I had a hard time adding products to the cart when creating the project. As it turned out, I made a mistake when creating the product model and successfully fixed the problem and moved on. 
In this project developed registration and login.
